<div>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div><div><br></div><div>Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows da<wbr>ta to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on GNU/Linux and Unix based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and other insecure remote shells, which send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to packet analysis. The encryption used by SSH provides confidentiality and integrity of da<wbr>ta over an insecure network, such as the Internet.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-size: medium;"  >Definition</span></b></div><div>SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; it can transfer files using the associated SFTP or SCP protocols.SSH uses the client-server model.</div><div><br></div><div>The standard TCP port 22 has been assigned for contacting SSH servers.</div><div>An SSH client program is typically used for establishing connections to an SSH daemon accepting remote connections. Both are commonly present on most modern operating systems, including Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and OpenVMS. Proprietary, freeware and open source versions of various levels of complexity and completeness exist.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-size: medium;"  >History and Development</span></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Version 1.0</b></div><div>In 1995, Tatu Yl?nen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, designed the first version of the protocol (now called SSH-1) prompted by a password-sniffing attack at his university network. The goal of SSH was to replace the earlier rlogin, TELNET and rsh protocols, which did not provide strong authentication or guarantee confidentiality. Yl?nen released his implementation as freeware in July 1995, and the tool quickly gained in popularity. Towards the end of 1995, the SSH user base had grown to 20,000 users in fifty countries.</div><div><br></div><div>In December 1995, Yl?nen founded SSH Communications Security to market and develop SSH. The original version of the SSH software used various pieces of free software, such as GNU libgmp, but later versions released by SSH Secure Communications evolved into increasingly proprietary software.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Version 2.0</b></div><div>"Secsh" was the official Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) name for the IETF working group responsible for version 2 of the SSH protocol.In 1996, a revised version of the protocol, SSH-2, was adopted as a standard. This version is incompatible with SSH-1. SSH-2 features both security and feature improvements over SSH-1. Better security, for example, comes through Diffie-Hellman key exchange and strong integrity checking via message authentication codes. New features of SSH-2 include the ability to run any number of shell sessions over a single SSH connection.</div><div><br></div><div><b>OpenSSH</b></div><div>In 1999, developers wanting a free software version to be available went back to the older 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license. Bj?rn Gr?nvall's OSSH was subsequently developed from this codebase. Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Gr?nvall's co<wbr>de and did extensive work on it, creating OpenSSH, which shipped with the 2.6 release of OpenBSD. From this version, a "portability" branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems.</div><div><br></div><div>It is estimated that, as of 2000, there were 2,000,000 users of SSH</div><div><br></div><div><div><b><span style="font-size: medium;"  >SSH-2 Internet Standard</span></b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Original Publication</b></div><div>In 2006, the aforementioned SSH-2 protocol became a proposed Internet standard with the publication by the IETF "secsh" working group of RFCs.
