<p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >From MSDN </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >A developer license for Windows&nbsp;8 lets you install, develop, test, and evaluate Windows Store apps before the Windows Store tests and certifies them. Developer licenses are free, and you can get as many as you need if you already have a Microsoft account. You don't need a Store account to get a developer license, but there might be advantages to having this kind of account. For example, you qualify for a longer developer license if you have a Windows Store account.  </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Before the Store accepts your Windows Store app, you must package it and get it certified according to certain rules. If the Windows Store hasn't certified a Windows Store app, the app can't run on Windows unless you have a developer license installed on the local machine or the app was sideloaded onto the machine by your enterprise. (This restriction doesn't apply to desktop apps.) Sideloading is the process of installing apps that were not distributed through the Windows Store, usually for testing an app before it is ready for sale. For more info on sideloading, see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=253132"  >What is sideloading? Does the Windows Store allow it?</a>   </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >The license is provided on a per-machine basis and for a fixed amount of time. After the developer license on your local machine expires, you won't be able to run uncertified apps but you can continue to run desktop apps or Windows Store apps that were sideloaded onto the machine. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >When you run or debug a Windows Store app for the first time on a remote machine or on a device that's directly connected to your development machine, you're prompted to download a separate developer license for that machine or device. Because you can't install a developer license on a machine remotely, you must use the machine or device itself to get the license. After you install a developer license on that remote machine or device, you can install, run, and debug packages that haven't been certified. The developer license on the remote machine doesn't affect apps that the Windows Store has already certified or desktop apps. </span></p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  ><strong>Getting a developer license through Visual Studio </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >When you run Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2012 on your local machine for the first time, you are prompted to obtain a developer license. Read the license terms, and then click <strong>I Agree</strong>. In the <strong>User Account Control (UAC)</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue.  </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >After you install a license on a local machine, you won't be prompted again on that machine unless the license expires (or you remove it) and you try to run an uncertified Windows Store app or create a project. You can run uncertified Windows Store apps on your local machine by pressing the F5 key in Microsoft Visual Studio or Blend for Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2012 for Windows&nbsp;8. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >You can renew your developer license any time you are using the Visual Studio IDE. If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio Express&nbsp;2012 for Windows&nbsp;8, click <strong>Store</strong> &gt; <strong>Acquire Developer License</strong>. If you are using a non-Express version of Visual Studio&nbsp;2012, click <strong>Project</strong>&gt; <strong>Store</strong> &gt; <strong>Acquire Developer License</strong>.  </span></p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  ><strong>Getting a developer license at a command prompt </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >If you aren't using Visual Studio&nbsp;2012, you can get and manage developer licenses at a command prompt by running these commands in Windows PowerShell:  </span></p><ul><li><div style="text-align: justify;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Show-WindowsDeveloperLicenseRegistration. This command opens a dialog box from which you can get a developer license and install it on the local machine. To run this command, you must have a valid Microsoft account. You also must run this command in a command prompt with elevated permissions.  </span></div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense. This command returns an object that has two properties: ExpirationTime and IsValid. ExpirationTime is a System.DateTime structure that contains the date and time when the license expires. IsValid is a System.Boolean that indicates whether the license is valid. You can run this command from either a non-elevated command prompt or a command prompt with elevated permissions.  </span></div></li><li><div style="text-align: justify;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Unregister-WindowsDeveloperLicense. This command warns you that some Windows Store apps will stop working if you remove the developer license from the local machine. If you choose "Yes" (the default) to confirm that you want to remove the license, the license is removed from the local machine. You must run this command in a command prompt with elevated permissions.  </span></div></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >The examples show the basic PowerShell syntax:  </span></p><p> &nbsp;</p><p style="background: #d9d9d9;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >C:\PS&gt; Show-WindowsDeveloperLicenseRegistration </span></p><p style="background: #d9d9d9;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >C:\PS&gt; Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense </span></p><p style="background: #d9d9d9;"  ><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >C:\PS&gt; Unregister-WindowsDeveloperLicense </span></p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  ><strong>Fraudulent use of your license </strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Microsoft can detect fraudulent use of a developer license on a registered machine. If Microsoft detects fraudulent use or another violation of the software license terms, we might revoke your developer license. The monitoring process helps ensure the overall health of the app marketplace.  </span></p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"  >Microsoft doesn't monitor the use of apps that the Windows Store has certified. Microsoft collects analytics for apps sold in the Store and provides those analytics to the developers who created those apps. For more info, see the software license terms for your edition of Windows. </span></p>
