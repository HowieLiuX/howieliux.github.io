<p>A Remote Desktop Services server has multiple namespaces for the following named kernel objects: events, semaphores, mutexes, waitable timers, file-mapping objects, and job objects. There is a global namespace used primarily by services in client/server applications. In addition, each client session has a separate namespace for these objects, such as in Windows&nbsp;Vista.</p> <p>The separate client session namespaces enable multiple clients to run the same applications without interfering with each other. For processes started under a client session, the system uses the session namespace by default. However, these processes can use the global namespace by prepending the "Global\" prefix to the object name. For example, the following co<wbr>de calls <a rel="nofollow" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682396.aspx"  ><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"  >CreateEvent</strong></a> and creates an event object named CSAPP in the global namespace:</p> <p><co><wbr>de&gt;CreateEvent( NULL, FALSE, FALSE, "Global\\CSAPP" );<wbr>de&gt;</p> <p>Service applications in a Remote Desktop Services environment use the global namespace by default. </p> <p>Session zero is on<wbr>ly used for hosting services, and there is no console session, unlike previous versions of Windows.</p> <p>The global namespace enables processes on multiple client sessions to communicate with a service application. For example, a client/server application might use a mutex object for synchronization. The server component can create the mutex object in the global namespace. Then a client session can use the "Global\" prefix to open the mutex object.</p> <p>Another use of the global namespace is for applications that use named objects to detect that there is already an instance of the application running in the system across all sessions. This named object must be created or opened in the global namespace instead of the per-session namespace. The more common case of running the application on<wbr>ce per session is supported by default because the named object is created in a per session namespace.</p> <p>In addition to the "Global\" prefix, client processes can use the "Local\" prefix to explicitly create an object in their session namespace. These keywords are case sensitive.</p> <p>The "Session\" prefix is reserved for system use and you should not use it in names of kernel objects. </p> <p>Fast user switching is implemented by using Remote Desktop Services sessions. The first user to log on uses session on<wbr>e, the next user to log on uses session two, and so on. Kernel object names must follow the guidelines outlined for Remote Desktop Services so that applications can support multiple users.</p> <p><b>The creation of a file-mapping object in the global namespace, by using </b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366537.aspx"  ><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"  ><b>CreateFileMapping</b></span></a><b>, from a session other than session zero is a privileged operation.
